## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) - For icons

### What I learned

Used variables in CSS for the first time. Also learned about custom icons (in my case, the ones from font awesome) which I'm still not able to use properly. This challenge sure took it's time. This challenge showed me where I really am. Compared to the ones I've done before this one was time-consuming for me. Also, I still don't know whether the below line is correct or not.

```html
<b class="fab fa-facebook-f"></b>
```

### Continued development

Continuing further, I'd like to focus on accessibility, more HTML and much more CSS.
